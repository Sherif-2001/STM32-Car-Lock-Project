# STM32 Car Lock Project

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a fully functional car lock system implemented using the STM32 microcontroller. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of STM32 in creating a secure and efficient car locking mechanism.

## Features

- **Keyless Entry:** Unlock your car without physically inserting a key.
- **Security:** Implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Optimize the system for minimal power usage to extend battery life.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32 microcontroller
- Power supply (battery or external power source)
- Other necessary components (sensors, buttons, etc.)

## Software Requirements

- Device drivers for peripherals
- RFID library for keyless entry
- C programming language for application development

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sherif-2001/stm32-car-lock.git
   cd stm32-car-lock
   ```

2. **Configure Hardware:**
- Connect the STM32 microcontroller to the necessary hardware components.

3. **Build and Flash:**
- Build the project in STM32CubeIDE and flash the firmware onto the microcontroller.

4. **Test the Car Lock:**
- Power up the system and test the car lock functionality.
- Use the keyless entry or remote control to lock and unlock the car.
